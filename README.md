# Mobius Strip Visualization, Surface Area and Edge Length Calculation

This project provides a Python implementation to visualize a Möbius strip and calculate its surface area and edge length.

## How to Run the Code

1. **Install Required Packages**

   Make sure you have Python installed. Then, install the required packages using the following command:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the Script**

   Execute the script to visualize the Möbius strip and print its surface area and edge length:

   ```bash
   python Modius.py
   ```

## Code Structure

The code is organized around a single class, `MobiusStrip`, which encapsulates all functionality related to the Möbius strip:

- **Initialization**: The constructor initializes the Möbius strip's radius, width, and resolution, and computes the mesh grid for visualization.
- **Mesh Computation**: The `_compute_mesh` method calculates the 3D coordinates of the Möbius strip using parametric equations.
- **Visualization**: The `visualize` method uses Matplotlib to render a 3D plot of the Möbius strip.
- **Surface Area Calculation**: The `surface_area` method approximates the surface area using numerical integration.
- **Edge Length Calculation**: The `edge_length` method calculates the length of the strip's edge using numerical integration.

## Surface Area Approximation

The surface area of the Möbius strip is approximated using numerical integration:

1. **Partial Derivatives**: Calculates the partial derivatives of the Möbius strip's parametric equations with respect to the parameters `u` and `v`.
2. **Cross Product**: Computes the cross product of the partial derivatives to obtain the differential area element.
3. **Integration**: Uses `scipy.integrate.dblquad` to integrate the magnitude of the cross product over the parameter space, yielding the total surface area.
